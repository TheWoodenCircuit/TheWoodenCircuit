### This repository contains tutorials and example for The Wooden Circuit projects

## What is this?
As mentioned above, this repository has code examples for different devices you may be using in your projects. You will most likely be using the Raspberry Pi Pico. Code examples for the Pico can be found in this repository.

*All devices will have necessary software pre-installed*

## Devices

### Raspberry Pi Pico
For coding on the Raspberry Pi Pico, you will be using [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org). CircuitPython is a variant of the [Python programming language](https://python.org). 

> Code for the Raspberry Pi Pico using CircuitPython can be found here under: Raspberry Pi Pico → examples → CircuitPython

**Any code editor can be used, however, as recommened by CircuitPython, beginners should use the [Mu Python editor](https://codewith.mu/).**
